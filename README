Description

Assignment for third year class to create a simple chemical reaction simulator.

Build instructions

Program was compiled using GNUstep/GCC, running on Ubuntu 12.04. Compilation command was:
gcc `gnustep-config --objc-flags` Reader.m Simulation.m -o main -lgnustep-base -lobjc -lbsd

BSD library is linked in for use of arc4random.

Note that solitary warning may occur: warning: no return statement in function returning nonvoid [-Wreturn-type]
Upon examination, it appears that this is a bug in the GNUstep compiler itself, and should be ignored.

Execution

After compilation, run with ./main [input script filepath] [output script filepath]
For example: ./main /home/bob/Documents/CSLP/doc/cascade.txt /home/bob/Documents/CSLP/doc/cascade.csv
Note that file paths must be absolute.
